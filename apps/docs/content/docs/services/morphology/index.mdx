2. [Status](/docs/services/morphology/documentValidationStatus): The status of the operation is queried to see if it is possible to proceed to obtain the result of the operation. this query must be made n times until the analysis operation has been completed.
3. [Data](/docs/services/morphology/documentValidationData): The results of the morphological analysis of the document are obtained.
