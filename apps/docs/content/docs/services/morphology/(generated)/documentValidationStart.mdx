          **The process consists of 3 steps:**


          1. **Start**: The information of the document (images, country and
          type of document) to be analyzed is sent.

          2. [Status](/docs/services/morphology/documentValidationStatus): The
          status of the operation is queried to see if it is possible to proceed
          to obtain the result of the operation. this query must be made n times
          until the analysis operation has been completed.

          3. [Data](/docs/services/morphology/documentValidationData): The
          results of the morphological analysis of the document are obtained.
