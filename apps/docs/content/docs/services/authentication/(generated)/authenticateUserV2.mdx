          This service validates both liveness and facial authentication. It
          compares the biometric template (templateRaw), which was previously
          validated and stored in the client's data repository during the
          Onboarding process, with a bestImageToken generated at the time of
          authentication.


          **Functionality**

          - **First Call**: Establishes a unique userId for the user.

          - **Authentication**: In each authentication attempt, the userId is
          sent along with the registered biometric template. This template is
          compared with the current tokenized image (bestImageToken). If there
          is a match and the liveness check is passed, the user is successfully
          authenticated.
