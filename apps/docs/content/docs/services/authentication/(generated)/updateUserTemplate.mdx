          The service allows the updating of the biometric template associated
          with a specific user. Its main function is to synchronize the user's
          most recent facial template stored in the client's data repository
          with a new template registered for the user.


          **Functionality**

          - **userId**: Unique identifier for the user, persisted and associated
          with the corresponding biometric template (oldRegisteredTemplateRaw).
          Needs to be at least two digits.

          - **image (Optional)**: Base64 formatted image obtained from the civil
          registry for authentication. Becomes mandatory if the registered
          biometric template (registeredTemplateRaw) is not provided.

          - **oldRegisteredTemplateRaw**: Currently registered template
          associated with the userId.

          - **registeredTemplateRaw**: New template to be associated with the
          userId. Must be persisted for future authentications.
