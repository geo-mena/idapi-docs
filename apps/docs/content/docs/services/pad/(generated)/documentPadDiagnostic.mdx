          Service that allows checking if the support of an identity document is
          genuine or not by verifying its image, in order to detect presentation
          attacks aimed at identity theft.


          The validation result can return the following values:

            - **Credible**: the document is genuine
            - **Doubtful**: it cannot be assured if the document is genuine
            - **Spoof**: the document appears not to be genuine
            - **Error**: the validation process encountered an error

          The result is provided in the **decision** field of the service
          response, along with the **reason** field specifying the cause for
          unsatisfactory validations. This API allows the morphological
          validation process of identity documents.
