## IAD Error Codes

The IAD (Injection Attack Detection) service returns specific error codes for various validation scenarios. These errors are returned as HTTP 400 Bad Request with detailed error information:

| HTTP Code | Message | Error Code | Description |
|---|---|---|---|

| 400 | Absolute face size is too small | FACE_TOO_SMALL | Face pixel density is too small, it should be closer to the camera view point or image should be higher resolution. |
| 400 | Relative face size is too small | FACE_TOO_SMALL | Face is too small, it should be closer to the camera view point, so it occupies a higher portion of the image. |
| 400 | Face is too close to one or more borders | FACE_CLOSE_TO_BORDER | Face is too close to the limit of the camera's view point, it should be centered corresponding with camera view. |
| 400 | Failed to parse file | UNKNOWN | File is not a correct encrypted blob payload or is corrupted. |
