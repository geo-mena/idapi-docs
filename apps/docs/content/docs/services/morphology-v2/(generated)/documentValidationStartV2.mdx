          2. [Status](/docs/services/morphology-v2/documentValidationStatusV2):
          The status of the operation is queried to see if it is possible to
          proceed to obtain the result of the operation. this query must be made
          n times until the analysis operation has been completed.

          3. [Data](/docs/services/morphology-v2/documentValidationDataV2): The
