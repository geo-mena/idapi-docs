This API allows the morphological validation process of identity documents.

## The process consists of 3 steps

1. [Start](/docs/services/morphology/documentValidationStart): The information of the document (images, country and type of document) to be analyzed is sent.
2. [Status](/docs/services/morphology/documentValidationStatus): The status of the operation is queried to see if it is possible to proceed to obtain the result of the operation. this query must be made n times until the analysis operation has been completed.
3. [Data](/docs/services/morphology/documentValidationData): The results of the morphological analysis of the document are obtained.

## Process Status

The status endpoint returns one of the following values to indicate the current state of the validation process:

| Status | Description |
|---|---|
| **PENDING** | Analysis in progress. **Recommended** polling every 5 seconds until completion. |
| **DONE** | Validation completed successfully. Execute the Document Validation Data service to retrieve the analysis results. |
| **FAILED** | Validation process encountered an error and could not be completed. |

## Verification Results

The `verification.status` field in the Document Validation Data response indicates the verification result:

| Status | Code | Description |
|---|---|---|
| **Started** | 7001 | Validation process has been initiated. |
| **Submitted** | 7002 | Submitted for validation processing. |
| **Approved** | 9001 | Successfully verified and approved. |
