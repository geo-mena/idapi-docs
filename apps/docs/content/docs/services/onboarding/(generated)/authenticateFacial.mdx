          This service can be used to perform the following validations:


          1. Facial authentication between two **open images**, generated or not
          by FacePhi widgets.

          2. Facial authentication between two **biometric templates**, requires
          integration of FacePhi Selphi Mobile or Web widget.

          3. Facial authentication between an **open image** and a **biometric
          template**, requires integration of FacePhi Selphi Mobile or Web
          widget.

          4. Facial authentication between the face present in **identity
          document photo (TokenFaceImage)** and an **open image**, requires
          integration of FacePhi SelphID Mobile widget.

          5. Facial authentication between the face present in **identity
          document photo (TokenFaceImage)** and a **biometric template**,
          requires integration of FacePhi Selphi Mobile and SelphID Mobile
          widgets.
