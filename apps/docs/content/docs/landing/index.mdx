title: How it works
---

Our biometric onboarding gateway is **very easy to use**, and we frame it within the **No-Code concept**, which means that you do **not need to know about programming** or have complex development teams to introduce it into your business processes.

To use our gateway you have **two methods** that differ from each other in whether you need to **send extra information** that you want our system to process or if your gateway will **not send such extra information**.

## Method with extra information (sdk client)

In order to integrate the landing we include a client-side SDK in which with two simple steps it is possible to invoke the landing from any client flow needed.

Installation is easy either through NPM or CDN.

### Installation with NPM

For the installation with npm the requirement is to have nodejs and npm installed, for more documentation on this aspect see here:

[An Absolute Beginner's Guide to Using npm](https://nodesource.com/blog/an-absolute-beginners-guide-to-using-npm/)

Once this step is completed the installation is very simple via command line in your repository execute:

```bash
npm install @facephi/landing-sdk
```

This will add the sdk to your project for use as follows:

```javascript
import LandingSDKClient from '@facephi/landing-sdk';

const landingSDK = new LandingSDKClient('YOUR_APIKEY');
```

Where API KEY will be provided by us or generated by you through the Landing Builder.

In order to invoke the post we will use the following command:

```javascript
landingSDK.callLanding();
```

For example:

```html
<html>
  <script type="module">
    import LandingSDKClient from './dist/landing-sdk.js';
    const landingSDK = new LandingSDKClient('YOUR_APIKEY');

    const callLanding = () => {
      landingSDK.callLanding();
    }

    window.callLanding = callLanding;   
  </script>
  <body>
    <div>
      Landing SDK Client
      <button onclick="callLanding()">Go to Landing</button>
    </div>
  </body>
</html>
```

The callLanding method allows you to add the following optional parameters:

| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| customerId | This identifier will allow you to associate the biometric operation generated in our processes with your customer, it can be your email or an identifier that you have of your users. |
| documentNumber | This parameter is optional, you can send your customer's ID number if you have one so that we can compare it with the biometric data obtained by our process. |
| callbackPath | Define the parameters to be added to the Callback URL call that we will execute to send the data captured by the biometric process. |

For example:

```javascript
landingSDK.callLanding({
  customerId: 'CUSTOMER_ID',
  documentNumber: 'DOCUMENT_NUMBER',
  callbackPath: 'CALLBACK_PATH'
})
```

### Configuration with Iframe

The Landing SDK allows the landing page to be launched in an iframe that will be superimposed on the client's page.

To activate this method, the following configuration must be used:

```javascript
const landingSDK = new LandingSDKClient('YOUR_APIKEY',  {
  iframe: true
});
```

<Callout type="warn">
To enable the iframe mode of the SDK, the **Facephi support team must configure the allowed URLs** for embedding the iframe. This is a critical security measure designed to protect your application and your users.

If the allowed URLs are not properly configured, attackers could embed the iframe on unauthorized websites to impersonate your brand. This could lead to **phishing attacks** targeting your customers, potentially compromising sensitive information.

By enforcing URL restrictions, only trusted and pre-configured domains will be allowed to use the iframe, significantly reducing the risk of such attacks.

If you require iframe mode for your integration, please **contact the Facephi support team** to provide a list of the URLs where the iframe will be embedded.
</Callout>

<Callout type="error">
With this method activated when the callLanding method is called the Landing will be added inside the client page with an iframe, it must be taken into account that this iframe is placed occupying 100% of the page in a layer in **zIndex 100000**. That is to say, if something with a higher zIndex is placed, it will be **superimposed over the landing**.
</Callout>

Once the landing process is finished the iframe will be closed. If you want to execute some functionality after the landing process is finished you have a method that is executed afterwards:

```javascript
landingSDK.callLanding({
  onFinish: () => {
    /// Run your code here
  }
})
```

### Configuration with Unique Url

<Callout>
This method is only available as of version 0.4.0
</Callout>

The SDK allows to generate a **unique url** for the landings, this URL will have a validation time of **15 minutes**, after that time the url will be **invalidated** and a new one will need to be generated. It is important to configure in the Builder the parameter that allows you to **disable public access** to the landings.

To activate this method, the following configuration must be used:

```javascript
const landingSDK = new LandingSDKClient('YOUR_APIKEY',  {
  uniqueUrl: true
});
```

### Installation with CDN

The installation from CDN is very simple as you don't have to do any previous installation steps, just add it as follows:

```html
<html>
  <script type="module">
    import LandingSDKClient from 'https://sdk-web.facephi.pro/landing-sdk/landing-sdk.js';
    const landingSDK = new LandingSDKClient('YOUR_APIKEY');

    const callLanding = () => {
      landingSDK.callLanding();
    }

    window.callLanding = callLanding;   
  </script>
  <body>
    <div>
      Landing SDK Client
      <button onclick="callLanding()">Go to Landing</button>
    </div>
  </body>
</html>
```

## Method with extra information (form)

If you need our gateway to process extra information from your customers or receive information that only you handle, you must use the POST method. It is very simple to call our landing through a POST call introducing in the body the following fields:

| FIELD | DESCRIPTION |
|-------|-------------|
| apiKey | This is the parameter with which we process the gateway entry security and the data handling inside the gateway. This parameter will be provided by us. |
| customerId | This identifier will allow you to associate the biometric operation generated in our processes with your customer, it can be your email or an identifier that you have of your users. |
| documentNumber | This parameter is optional, you can send your customer's ID number if you have one so that we can compare it with the biometric data obtained by our process. |
| callbackPath | Define the parameters to be added to the Callback URL call that we will execute to send the data captured by the biometric process. |

Here is how to send these parameters and call our gateway in html:

### Example in HTML

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
  <title>Example</title>
</head>
<body>
  <form action="https://url-example-landing" method="POST">
    <label for="apiKey">API Key:</label>
    <input type="text" name="apiKey" id="apiKey"><br>

    <label for="customerId">Customer ID:</label>
    <input type="text" name="customerId" id="customerId"><br>

    <label for="documentNumber">Document Number:</label>
    <input type="text" name="documentNumber" id="documentNumber"><br>

    <label for="callback Path">Callback Path:</label>
    <input type="text" name="callbackPath" id="callbackUrl"><br>

    <input type="submit" value="Send">
  </form>
</body>
</html>
```

## Method without extra information

In this case the process is much simpler, the apiKey is provided by us automatically to the landing without the need to generate it, you just have to integrate the url of our gateway in the flow you want. The data will be provided to the client through a webhook.
